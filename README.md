# PyDiscle
Python implementation of Discle, the disc gold disc mold Wordle

The player essentially has a set number of guess to figure out which mold is the correct answer.

Each round the player guesses a mold, and if incorrect, the game will tell the player certain pieces of information.

Said pieces of information:
* Manufacturer
* Speed
* Glide
* Turn
* Fade
* Type

For the flight numbers, the game will tell the player if the actual number is higher or lower than the guess. For the manufacturer and type, it will just tell the player whether or not the guess is correct.
